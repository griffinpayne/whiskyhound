# WhiskyHound

WhiskyHound is a whisky auction price scraper tailored for [Whisky Auctioneer](https://www.whiskyauctioneer.com/). It provides users with the ability to efficiently search and retrieve the winning bid prices for a specified whisky whisky (or brand, bottles, etc., just add OR between search terms) from the search results, without having to navigate to each auction lot URL individually.

To avoid any potential IP blocks when running this scraper for extended periods or frequently, consider using a VPN.

## Features

- Retrieves the winning bids directly from the search results, based on the specified criteria, eliminating the need to navigate to each individual auction lot URL, allowing for price analysis easily.
- Extracts the brand and bottling details from the auction lot URLs for more structured and meaningful results.
- Multi-threaded scraping to optimize the retrieval process.
- Option to output the scraped results to a CSV file, with structured columns for Brand, Bottling, URL, and Price.
- Retry mechanism to enhance robustness.
